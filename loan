Write a program to approve a loan
banking to buy a house. The program will:
- ask the value of the house;
- the salary of the buyer and;
- in how many years will he pay

Calculate the amount of the monthly installment knowing that it
CANNOT EXCEED 30% of the salary or else the loan
will be denied'''

casa = float(input('Home value: '))
salario = float(input('Buyer's salary: '))
anos = int(input('How many years of financing?: '))
prestacao = casa / (anos*12)
minimo = salario * 30 / 100 # 30%
print('o pay off a house worth {:.2f} in {} years, the installment will be {:.2f}'.format(casa, anos, prestacao))
if prestacao <= minimo:
    print('APPROVED loan')
else:
    print('loan DENIED')
